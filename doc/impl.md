# Implementation

## Password storage

Passwords are stored in the non-volatile Flash memory of the device, in the
application space. The manager can store up to 64 passwords (this can be
increased in the source code, at the cost of application size). Each password is
stored on an individual 64 bytes flash page, to allow atomic insertion and
deletion (see `nvm::Collection` in the NanoS Rust SDK).

Each 64 bytes password entry is divided in two 32 bytes blocks: one for the
password name, and the other for the password itself. The name and password can
be of variable size, up to 32 bytes each. The 32 bytes blocks are padded with
zeros. ASCII characters should be stored (UTF8 may work except for the last
character if it ends with a null byte).

## APDUs

All APDUs use the class `0x80`.

## GetVersion

Returns version string, for instance "1.0.0".

## GetSize

Returns the number of passwords stored.
User consent is not required for this operation.

The device sends the result encoded in big-endian with 4-bytes.

## Add

Add a new password in the internal collection.
This operation requires user consent.

The P1 field can be:
- 0: password is passed in the Data field
- 1: password is randomly generated by the device.

The Data field of the command must have the 32 bytes for the
name (padded with zeros) and 32 bytes for the password (padded
with zeros) if device generation is not requested.

## GetName

Returns the name of the n-th password stored.
User consent is not required for this operation.

The Data field of the APDU must contain the password index, encoded in
big-endian with 4 bytes

## GetByName

Returns the password with the given name.
This operation requires user consent.

The Data field of the APDU must contain the password name on 32-bytes (padded
with zeros).

The device responds with the 32-bytes password (padded with zeros).

## DeleteByName

Delete the password with the given name.
This operation requires user consent.

The Data field of the APDU must contain the password name on 32-bytes (padded
with zeros).

## Export

Starts export procedure.
This operation requires user consent.

The P1 field can be:
- 0: passwords are exported in plaintext. A warning message is displayed to the
  user. Any device can import the returned data.
- 1: passwords are returned encrypted and MACed. Only a device with the same
  seed can import the returned data.

Once the export procedure has been started, each password must be retrieved
with the ExportNext command. The export procedure ends when all passwords have
been readout.

## ExportNext

Export the next password during the export procedure.
User consent is not required for this operation (verified during Export).

If plaintext mode is selected, the device responds with the name and password
blocks (2 * 32 bytes) in plaintext.

If encrypted export mode is selected, the device responds with a 16-bytes nonce,
followed by encrypted name and password, and finally a 16-bytes MAC used to
verify integrity during import.

## Import

Starts the import procedure.
This operation requires user consent.

The P1 field can be:
- 0: passwords are imported in plaintext.
- 1: passwords are imported encrypted and MAC is verified.

The Data field must contain the number of passwords to be imported, encoded in
big-endian with 4 bytes.

Once the import procedure has been started, each password must be imported with
the ImportNext command. The import procedure ends when all passwords have been
imported, or if a MAC verification fails.

## ImportNext

Import the next password during the import procedure.
User consent is not required for this operation (verified during Import).

The Data field must contain the Data blob received during export. It can be in
plaintext if the plaintext mode has been selected, or encrypted.

## Clear

Remove all password.
User consent is not required for this operation.

## Quit

Quit application to return to the dashboard.
User consent is not required for this operation.

## GetByNameInternal

Display on the device the password with the given name.
This operation requires user consent.

The Data field of the APDU must contain the password name on 32-bytes (padded
with zeros).
